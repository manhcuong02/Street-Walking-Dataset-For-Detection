# Street-Walking-Dataset-For-Detection

## Overview
Welcome to the Street-Walking Dataset for Object Detection! This dataset offers a comprehensive collection of street scenes from two dynamic cities: Hanoi and New York City. Captured by the renowned [WALKS and the CITY](https://www.youtube.com/@WALKS_and_the_CITY) and [Vietnam Walking Tours](https://www.youtube.com/@vietnam4kwalking) channels, our dataset provides a rich resource for urban research and computer vision tasks.

## Dataset Details
- Size: : The dataset consists of 2499 images extracted from videos provided by the two aforementioned channels. Each image is selected at intervals of 240 frames from the videos.
- Annotation: Leveraging the power of yolov8x and label-studio, the dataset is meticulously annotated, ensuring precise labeling of objects.
- Annotated Objects: The dataset covers a wide array of objects, ranging from pedestrians to various vehicles including cars, bicycles, motorcycles, buses, and trucks. Each object is annotated with utmost accuracy, capturing their presence even in challenging scenarios such as partial obstructions or distant perspectives.
- Diverse Conditions: Embracing the diversity of urban environments, the dataset encompasses different weather conditions, including rainy days, sunny weather, and nighttime scenes. This diversity ensures robust model training, enabling algorithms to adapt effectively to various environmental factors.
- Enhanced Object Detection: Designed with a focus on vehicle detection, the dataset is tailored to enhance object detection performance, particularly for smaller objects. This optimization ensures superior model performance across a wide range of conditions and scenarios.
